Yes, it is True! The long-awaited switch statement is finally added in Python v3.10! It's syntax is tad bit similar to the switch statement from C language. But it is named as 'match' statement.

The generic syntax of pattern matching is:
```python
match subject:
    case <pattern_1>:
        <action_1>
    case <pattern_2>:
        <action_2>
    case <pattern_3>:
        <action_3>
    case _:
        <action_wildcard>
```

A match statement takes an expression and compares its value to successive patterns given as one or more case blocks. Specifically, pattern matching operates by:

	<p>evaluating the&nbsp;<code>subject</code>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<code>match</code>&nbsp;statement</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>comparing the subject with each pattern in a&nbsp;<code>case</code>&nbsp;statement from top to bottom until a match is confirmed.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>executing the action associated with the pattern of the confirmed match</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If an exact match is not confirmed, the last case, a wildcard&nbsp;<code>_</code>, if provided, will be used as the matching case. If an exact match is not confirmed and a wildcard case does not exist, the entire match block is a no-op</p>
	</li>
</ol>
