It allows us to write HTML inside JavaScript and place them in the DOM without using functions like `appendChild( )` or `createElement( )`.

- Without using JSX, we would have to create an element by the following process:

```javascript
const text = React.createElement('p', {}, 'This is a text');
const container = React.createElement('div','{}',text );
ReactDOM.render(container,document.getElementById('app'));
```

- Using JSX, the above code can be simplified:

````javascript
const container = (

 <div>
   <p>This is a text</p>
 </div>
);
ReactDOM.render(container,document.getElementById('app'));
````

As one can see in the code above, we are directly using HTML inside JavaScript\*
