### React State

Every component in react has a built-in state object, which contains all the property values that belong to that component.

In other words, the state object controls the behaviour of a component. Any change in the property values of the state object leads to re-rendering of the component.

Note- State object is not available in functional components but, we can use React Hooks to add state to a functional component.

How to declare a state object?

```javascript
Example:
class Car extends React.Component{
 constructor(props){
   super(props);
   this.state = {
     brand: "BMW",
     color: "black"
   }
 }
}
```

How to use and update the state object?

```javascript
class Car extends React.Component {
 constructor(props) {
   super(props);
   this.state = {
     brand: "BMW",
     color: "Black"
   };
 }

 changeColor() {
   this.setState(prevState => {
     return { color: "Red" };
   });
 }

 render() {
   return (
     <div>
       <button onClick={() => this.changeColor()}>Change Color</button>
       <p>{this.state.color}</p>
     </div>
   );
 }
}

```

As one can see in the code above, we can use the state by calling this.state.propertyName and we can change the state object property using setState method.

### React Props

Every react component, accepts a single object argument called props (which stands for “properties”).

These props can be passed to a component using HTML attributes.

Using props, we can pass data from one component to another.

- While rendering a component, we can pass the props as a HTML attribute:

```javascript
<Car brand="Mercedes"/>
```

The component receives the props:

In Class component:

```javascript
class Car extends React.Component {
 constructor(props) {
   super(props);
   this.state = {
     brand: this.props.brand,
     color: "Black"
   };
 }
}
```

In Functional component:

```javascript
function Car(props) {
  render() {
      return <h1>Name is {props.name}!</h1>;
   }
}
```

**Note- Props are read-only. They cannot be manipulated or changed inside a component**
