Hooks are functions that let us “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from a `functional component.`
React Hooks cannot be used in class components.

Why were Hooks introduced in React?
React hooks were introduced in the 16.8 version of React.
Previously, functional components were called stateless components. Only class components were used for state management and lifecycle methods.

The need to change a functional component to a class component, whenever state management or lifecycle methods were to be used, led to the development of Hooks.

**Example of a hook:**

`useState hook:`
In functional components, useState hook lets us define state for a component:

```javascript
function Person(props) {
 // We are declaring a state variable called name.
 // setName is a function to update/change the value of name
 let [name, setName] = useState('');
}
```
